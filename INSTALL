Installation Instructions
*************************

For Linux users, run the following commands on the root folder of the project:

    $ autoreconf -i

This will generate the configure script for the program.

    $ ./configure --prefix=`pwd`

This will run the configure script to generate the necessary Makefiles to
compile the game and install it to the current directory. The prefix will
change in the future once we figure out where to put the resources used in the
game. It is recommended that you add `CXXFLAGS="-Wall -ggdb"` at the end of
the command to configure for a debuggable build.

    $ make

This command will start the compilation of the game. If you have a multi-core
system it is recommended that you add `-jX` (replace `X` with half the number
of CPU cores in your system) to speed up the compilation.

    $ make install

This command will make the system install(copy) the binary into the `bin`
folder. To run the game, simply run:

    $ cd bin
    $ ./DuelJam
